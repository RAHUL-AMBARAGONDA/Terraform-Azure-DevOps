Dev Module README.md Explanation
The Dev module in your project is responsible for provisioning an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster in the development environment using Terraform. Below is a detailed breakdown of each file and its purpose.

📌 File Breakdown and Explanation
1️⃣ .terraform.lock.hcl
Purpose: Locks the Terraform provider versions to ensure consistency across deployments.

Why it matters: Prevents unwanted updates from breaking infrastructure by keeping dependencies locked to tested versions.

2️⃣ backend.tf
Purpose: Configures Terraform remote state management.

Typical content:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name   = "tfstate-rg"
    storage_account_name  = "tfstatestorage"
    container_name        = "tfstate"
    key                   = "dev.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
Why it matters:

Stores Terraform state remotely in Azure Storage to enable collaboration.

Helps avoid conflicts when multiple developers work on infrastructure.

3️⃣ main.tf
Purpose: Defines all the Azure resources for the Dev environment.

Typical content:

hcl
Copy
Edit
module "aks" {
  source              = "../Modules/AKS"
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  cluster_name        = var.cluster_name
  node_count         = var.node_count
}
Why it matters:

Uses a modular approach to keep the Terraform code clean and reusable.

Calls the AKS module to provision the Kubernetes cluster.

4️⃣ terraform.tfvars
Purpose: Contains environment-specific variable values.

Typical content:

h
Copy
Edit
resource_group_name = "dev-rg"
cluster_name        = "dev-aks"
node_count         = 2
Why it matters:

Separates configuration values from code.

Ensures different environments (Dev, Staging, Prod) have separate configurations.

5️⃣ variables.tf
Purpose: Declares all the input variables for Terraform.

Typical content:

hcl
Copy
Edit
variable "resource_group_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of the resource group"
}

variable "cluster_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name of the AKS cluster"
}

variable "node_count" {
  type        = number
  description = "Number of nodes in the AKS cluster"
  default     = 2
}
Why it matters:

Improves reusability by allowing customization through terraform.tfvars.

Ensures type safety for variable values.

💡 How the Dev Module Works
Terraform initializes using terraform init (installs required providers and modules).

Terraform plan (terraform plan) previews the infrastructure changes.

Terraform apply (terraform apply) provisions the AKS cluster in the development environment.

Terraform destroy (terraform destroy) removes the infrastructure when no longer needed.

🚀 Best Practices
✔ Use remote backend storage for Terraform state (backend.tf).
✔ Keep secrets in Azure Key Vault (avoid hardcoding credentials).
✔ Follow modular design (main.tf calls AKS module for reuse).
✔ Use separate terraform.tfvars per environment (Dev, Staging, Prod).
