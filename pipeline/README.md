## ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

### ðŸš€ `create.yaml`
- Defines the **CI/CD pipeline** for creating infrastructure using Terraform.
- Executes Terraform commands in a structured manner.
- Example workflow:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init
    
    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan
    
    - name: Terraform Apply
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```
- Ensures a **repeatable, automated deployment** process.

### ðŸ”¥ `destroy.yaml`
- Automates **infrastructure teardown** when no longer needed.
- Example workflow:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init
    
    - name: Terraform Destroy
      run: terraform destroy -auto-approve
  ```
- Helps in **cost management** and keeping environments clean.

## âœ… Best Practices
âœ” Use **separate workflows** for creation and destruction to avoid accidental deletions.  
âœ” Implement **approval mechanisms** in CI/CD pipelines for production environments.  
âœ” Store **Terraform state remotely** to enable team collaboration.  
âœ” Use **secrets management** for sensitive data like API keys and credentials.
